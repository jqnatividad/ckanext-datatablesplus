extended datatables.net CKAN resource viewer

As part of the Analyze Boston project, a usability study was done by the City and found that the recline-based data viewer had a lot of usability issues for non-technical users.

As a result, some core CKAN work was sponsored to add a new data viewer to CKAN using datatables.net.  This functionality was released with CKAN 2.7 as a built-in plugin in 2016.

Datatables has released a lot of new features since then (searchpanes, searchbuilder, etc.), and this CKAN extension aims to expose the full power of datatables in CKAN.
